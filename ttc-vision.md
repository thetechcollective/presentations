<q>We want to be be recognized as the one-stop partner for (wicked) problem-solving across the full SDLC, by leveraging both advisory- and implementation services</q>
<!-- .element style="color:white;" -->

Note:
This is trying to embrace the _big we_ including _all_ of .t&do but clearly we're speaking from _our_ (.tech that) perspective. Software is eating the world, we need more software!

All we do collectively in .t&do; 

- Test automation
- Test management
- Experience design
- Software Product Development

...has only **_one_** underlying bridge that unites us: Software deliveries!

A joint vision statement _must_ revolve around _software something_

# Services

We have several thing we believe we can _potentially_ deliver. And consequently make the foundation of our business model. Each service requires separate strategy and tactics.

Note:
The more services we deliver the more strategies we must develop and optimize. For a smaller team with limited bandwidth it makes sense to focus-

# Eric Rice
#### Note to self...
On **explore**. vs **exploit**

<q>Dear Eric, thank you for your service to this company. Unfortunately, the job you have been doing is no longer available, and the company you used to work for no longer exists. However, we are pleased to offer you a new job at an entirely new company, that happens to contain all the same people as before. This new job began months ago, and you are already failing at it. Luckily, all the strategies you’ve developed that made you successful at the old company are entirely obsolete. Best of luck!</q>
