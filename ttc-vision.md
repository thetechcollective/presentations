<q>We want to be be recognized as the one-stop partner for (wicked) problem-solving across the full SDLC, by leveraging both advisory- and implementation services</q>
<!-- .element style="color:white;" -->

Note:
This is trying to embrace the _big we_ including _all_ of .t&do but clearly we're speaking from _our_ (.tech that) perspective. Software is eating the world, we need more software!

All we do collectively in .t&do; 

- Test automation
- Test management
- Experience design
- Software Product Development

...has only **_one_** underlying bridge that unites us: Software deliveries!

A joint vision statement _must_ revolve around _software somethhing_
