# Exercise 1

Deliver a strategy based on the vision

---

## Define the problem (challenge) youself

#### ...as if it was a prompt to a GPT

Define the challenge as you see it.

- Give some context (the more the better)
- Be explict about the format of the output (this is a solution to ...what exactly)
- Control the direction (GPTs tend to paraphrase you own prompt â€“ they are _confirmation biased_)

## Propmt Example

Our tech company is called "Test & DevOps". We are 30+ full-time employees. It has existed for four years.  We deliver servies within four distinct SME areas: Test Automation, Test Management, Software Development and Customer Experience design. We are a subsidiary of a management consultulting bureau with 1700 management consultants. Our compnay is a sub brand under theirs and most of the work we deliver is done in the role as sub supplier to our mother company.

One specific overarching problem we've had up until now is, that even though our four SME areas are individually successful - we're mostly delivering individually within each area. In reality we're not that good at joining forces and delivering together.

We have come up program we call "The New Us" and a new vision statment: _"We want to be be recognized as the one-stop partner for wicked problem-solving across the full SDLC, by leveraging both advisory- and implementation services"_. This vision is also indicating that we're aiming to step out of the shadow of our mother comapgny and start building our own customer relations where we can deliver more holistic services - using the full potential of all colleagues in "Test and DevOps"

Our next step is to come up with a strategy to deliver on this. Please held formulate this strategy - consider the following:

- What products and services should we develop? 
- What's the narrative that will attract attention from both potential customers and potential recruits?
- What could be or _"why"_ ...or our _"purpose"_ in this narrative?
- The realtionship between _Vision_ -> _Strategy_ -> _Tactics_ is not alwasy obvious to engineer profiles like us - we're not business developers, we're developers and designers - please deliver the strategy in a format that is very concrete and very actionable.
- Please suplement with - whatever - is considered necessary to complete a stretegy.
- In the context of OKE - please suggest one or two objectives, we can fouc on in the next comming quater.
