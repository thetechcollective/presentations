The journey to the vision is called a **strategy** — in other words we need to come up with a strategy

## Exercise 1

#### Define the problem yourself - as if it was a prompt to a GPT

Define the challenge as you see it<br/>
Describe what outcome you wish for

- **Give some context**<br/>_the more the better_
- **Be explicit about the format of the output**<br/>_this is a solution to ...what exactly?_
- **Control the direction**<br/>_GPTs tend to paraphrase you own prompt – and to be confirmation biased_

<!-- .element: style="font-size:25px;" -->

Note:
This deliberate formulated without any specific details;

We need a strategy to the vision ..whatever that is!

## Prompt Example

Our tech company "Test & DevOps" has been in business for four years. We are 30+ full-time employees. We deliver services within four distinct SME areas: Test Automation, Test Management, Software Development and Customer Experience design. We are a subsidiary of a management consulting bureau with 1700 management consultants. Our company is one of eight, that live together under a sub brand: "The Tech Collective" which mostly serve as a sub supplier to our mother company.

One specific overarching problem we've had up until now is, that even though our four SME areas are individually successful - we're mostly delivering individually within each area. In reality we're not that good at joining forces and delivering together.

We have come up with an renewal program we call "The New Us" and a new vision statement: _"We want to be be recognized as the one-stop partner for wicked problem-solving across the full SDLC, by leveraging both advisory- and implementation services"_. This vision is also indicating that we're aiming to step out of the shadow of our mother company and start building our own customer relations where we can deliver more holistic services - using the full potential of all colleagues in "Test and DevOps"

Our next step is to come up with a strategy to deliver on this. Please help formulate this strategy - consider the following:

- What products and services should we develop?
- Are there any other SME areas that should be covered to be truly holistic?
- What's the narrative that will attract attention from both potential customers and potential recruits?
- What could be or _"why"_ or our _"purpose"_ in this narrative?
- The _Vision_ drives _Strategy_ which drive _Tactics_: Please deliver the strategy in a format that is very concrete and very actionable - it should point to tactics.
- Internally we're working with Objectives and Key Results (OKR). In that context - please suggest one or two objectives, we can focus on in the next coming quarter.

Note:
The team can use this prompt, or another, or parts of it. It's up to them!

## Exercise 2

### Explore outcomes — prepare strategy

Throw your prompt to a GPT of you liking<br/>
...or try to answer it yourself in the group

Curate, refine, paraphrase, adjust and finalize you strategy to a format<br/>
you can [present and share](https://implementcg.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/BrandCentral/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BBEFA7552-20F4-423B-ACC5-B77986632C1C%7D&file=The%20tech%20collective_16-9.potx) to all of "Test & DevOps" in 10 mins<br/>
(including questions and feedback from audience)

<!-- .element: style="font-size:25px;" -->

Note:
The slide contains a link to "The Tech Collective" PowerPoint template from Brand Central

There are no rules - other than the the team will own the agenda for ten minutes
